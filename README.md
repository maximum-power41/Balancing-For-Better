# Balancing-For-Better
A Fabric mod for Minecraft that attempts to balance the game to be more enjoyable.

### Current changes:
* Mending Enchantment Book no longer shows up in villager trades.

### RoadMap:
* Make diamond armor, weapons, and tools more rare or unavailable in villager trades.
* Balance enchantments.
  * This can include adding or removing enchantments and changing their mechanics.
* Make lingering potions made with bottles of honey instead of dragon's breath.
* Make villager trades stay the same per villager profession instance. (No more rerolling a villager's trades by breaking their "job site" block.)
* Make the penalty for anvil uses less or remove it.

_Note: Roadmap is subject to change._

# Balancing-Minecraft
A Fabric mod for Minecraft that attempts to rebalance the game to be more enjoyable.

### Current changes:
* Mending Enchantment Book no longer shows up in villager trades.

### RoadMap:
* Make diamond armor, weapons, and tools more rare or unavailable in villager trades.
* Rebalance enchantments.
* Make lingering potions made with bottles of honey instead of dragon's breath.
* Make villager trades stay the same per villager profession instance. (No more rerolling a villager's trades by breaking their "job site" block.)

*Note: Roadmap is subject to change.*
